Usage:

1) Save the server.py script on the server machine, make it executable
2) Set the HOST parameter on line 14 of list_client_programs.py to the ip address of the server
2) Save the list_client_programs.py script on the client machine, make it executable
3) Run ./server.py on the server machine
4) Run ./list_client_programs.py on the client machine
5) Running program data will be saved to the same repository as the script

Notes / Improvements:

* Only supports IPv4
* Should be capturing any errors opening/closing files/sockets
* Should consider rotation/cleanup of output files
* Size of data sent / read - is 1024 optimal?
* Clearer usage information and addition of --help output
* Messy to use temporary file for processing data on client side
* Also slow, would be better to use in-memory buffer
* Also the temp file never gets cleaned up
* No failure tolerance, if the script breaks, no more data until we run list_client_programs and server again
* Would be better to leave server open and run client process as a cronjob
* Needs linting
* Should abstract repeated code - (e.g. logic to create the unique filenames)
* Not much logging output for user
* No requirements.txt or package structure (though no requirements beyond python3)
* Question mark over portability to other operating systems
* Re the "EOF" marker, server.py should deal with normal case first, exceptional case after
* What if a process has the string "EOF" in its name?
* 5 seconds is a magic value, should be at least a constant, better a command line option
* Server IP address is a magic value, should be a command line option


Tests to consider:

Test that all of mock ps output data turns up in output file as expected (i.e. output file is complete)
Test output file contains no duplicate information
Test output file contains no information that is not in mock ps output data (i.e. output file is accurate)
Test what would happen if process interrupted on either machine (currently would fail)
